# Online Distributed Eigenspaces

## Introduction
- Principal component analysis (PCA) is dimensionality reduction technique.
- We propose `distributed eigenspaces` to improve PCA performance.
- Our work is based on a recent paper that introduces the algorithm[1].
- We apply our implementation on CIFAR-10 dataset[2] 

## First point
Concepts of an online algorithm,

## Second point
The distributed algorithm,
Kind of parallel algorithm that is designed to be run on hardware consisting of interconnected processors
